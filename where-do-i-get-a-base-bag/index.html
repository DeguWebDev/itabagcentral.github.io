					<p><strong><a href="https://www.animate-onlineshop.jp/sphone/products/list.php?mode=search&amp;smt=%E7%97%9B%E3%83%90%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animate</a></strong><br>Official, high quality bags. Animate also sells anime merch and other items.&nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong><a href="https://item.rakuten.co.jp/thank-you-mart/02-02163/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thank You Mart</a></strong><br>Low quality bags.

				<hr>
				<h2>Cheaper, Unofficial/Bootleg Bags</h2>
					<p><strong><a href="/aliexpress-base-bags/">AliExpress</a></strong><br>Cheap, lower quality on some bags. You pay for what you get. As with ordering from AliExpress, stuff will take several weeks to a month to arrive. Most of the bags are not “official” but some are very well made. If you have any questions about a certain bag, feel free to contact one of the mods!</p>
					<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=itabag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a> / <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_nkw=ita+bag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eBay</a> / <a href="https://www.depop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Depop</a></strong><br>Most bags on these sites will be from resellers off of AliExpress or Taobao. But some bags sold on here can be official too, ask the seller if you are unsure. Shipping cost and price varies, so do your research! If you have any questions about a certain bag, feel free to contact one of the mods!</p>
